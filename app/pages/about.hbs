                Hello, my name is Andrew Delos Reyes. I am a Computer Science major attending CSUF, 
                and it is my last semester here. I've been enjoying video games since I was five 
                years old, and have gone pro in some games. I've been practicing making my own games 
                for about 2 years now so that I may be able to release a high quality game on Steam 
                one day, as a way of giving back to the community.

                Hi, I'm Victoria! I'm a senior at CSUF, majoring in computer science. I have a passion 
                for travel, with Austria holding a special place in my heart. When I'm not traveling, 
                I love to hang out with my dogs and my friends. For me, fulfillment comes from exploring 
                new horizons and cherishing the simple moments at home. I chose computer science for a 
                couple of reasons. First, it's flexible; I can work from pretty much anywhere, so it fits my 
                love for travel. Second, I genuinely enjoy the challenge of solving problems — it keeps 
                things interesting for me.

               My name is KJ! I enjoy the process of making things that make other people’s lives 
               easier. My projects range anywhere from lockout buzzers, to a car jukebox, and 
               tinkering with a whole bunch of other stuff as well. I am continuing down the educational 
               path of software engineering to feed my passion for creating new things :)
