                Hello, my name is Andrew Delos Reyes. I am a Computer Science major attending CSUF, 
                and it is my last semester here. I've been enjoying video games since I was five 
                years old, and have gone pro in some games. I've been practicing making my own games 
                for about 2 years now so that I may be able to release a high quality game on Steam 
                one day, as a way of giving back to the community.

                Hi, I'm Victoria! I'm a senior at CSUF, majoring in computer science. I have a passion 
                for travel, with Austria holding a special place in my heart. When I'm not traveling, 
                I love to hang out with my dogs and my friends. For me, fulfillment comes from exploring 
                new horizons and cherishing the simple moments at home. I chose computer science for a 
                couple of reasons. First, it's flexible; I can work from pretty much anywhere, so it fits my 
                love for travel. Second, I genuinely enjoy the challenge of solving problems — it keeps 
                things interesting for me.

                Hi, I'm Arish Imam. I've got a background in Computer Science which powers my day-to-day life 
                as a Software Engineer. When I'm not diving into code or designing the next cool website, you 
                can catch me chasing after that elusive perfect golf swing. By weekday, I'm all about the digital 
                realm; by weekend, it's all fairways and greens!

               My name is KJ! I enjoy the process of making things that make other people’s lives 
               easier. My projects range anywhere from lockout buzzers, to a car jukebox, and 
               tinkering with a whole bunch of other stuff as well. I am continuing down the educational 
               path of software engineering to feed my passion for creating new things :)
